  title: "Why I am an Atheist",
  summary: "In this powerful essay written from jail, Bhagat Singh explains his rejection of religion and his belief in rationalism, logic, and social justice over blind faith.",
  content: `
Bhagat Singh wrote this essay in 1930 while imprisoned in Lahore Central Jail. It was a response to those who accused him of becoming an atheist due to his revolutionary arrogance. In reality, Singh was deeply thoughtful and believed in questioning traditional beliefs with reason.

ðŸ”¸ He explains that he used to be religious in his early life, but later turned toward science, logic, and social reform.

ðŸ”¸ He argues that freedom fighters should rely on human effort, not divine miracles.

ðŸ”¸ Bhagat strongly criticizes blind faith, rituals, and the idea that God will fix societal problems.

ðŸ”¸ He believed that religion often distracts people from real issues like poverty, inequality, and oppression.

ðŸ”¸ He quotes thinkers like Marx and Lenin, and shows that true revolutionaries must be rational and fearless.

At just 23, Bhagat Singhâ€™s clarity of thought and philosophical maturity shine in this essay. It remains one of the strongest intellectual writings of any Indian freedom fighter.

He ends with a powerful note: "I am an atheist, not because I am egoistic, but because I believe in man, not in some unseen power."`
