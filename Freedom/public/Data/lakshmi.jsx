    title: "Letter to British General",
    summary: "This fictionalized letter captures the voice of Rani Lakshmi Bai as she stands firm against British annexation, declaring her right to rule and protect Jhansi.",
    content: `
This powerful imagined letter reflects the courage and conviction of Rani Lakshmi Bai during the British attempt to take over Jhansi:

ðŸ”¸ "I was born free and I shall never accept the chains of subjugation."

ðŸ”¸ She reminds the British of her rightful heir, Damodar Rao, and questions their unjust policy of Doctrine of Lapse.

ðŸ”¸ Rani expresses her anger over the betrayal and misuse of treaties by the East India Company.

ðŸ”¸ She asserts that a woman may be a queen, but she is not weak â€” "My sword shall answer your injustice."

ðŸ”¸ The letter ends with a firm resolve: "Jhansi shall not be given. I will fight till my last breath, and I will win freedom or die trying."

Though symbolic, this letter captures the revolutionary spirit of the Rani, whose words still echo in the hearts of patriots.
